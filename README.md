# Github API Test

Your task is to develop a single page application that connects to the https://docs.github.com/en/rest and retrieves repository data based on user input.

Upon retrieval you should build an appropriate UI for the data, treating accessibility as a first class citizen.

The UI should display counts for stars, forks, likes, and issues per repository. Links to the repository and the author should be visible and finally, a detailed view whereby we will be
able to read the readme details.

During development we'd ask that you publish your code to a public repository (Github,
Gitlab or Bitbucket).

You should ideally spend no longer than an evening on this test, and your repository should contain a readme detailing your solution, along with any other information you think relevant to support your submission.

### Technical Requirements

- The solution must work in a modern browser
- The code must be pushed to a public repository
- The readme should contain steps so that we can run your solution locally

### System Requirements

The following form a basic set of acceptance criteria for your submission, they are deliberately basic to allow you room to expand in areas you think appropriate.

- Must be a single page application.
- Must retrieve data from the Github REST API, how you do this is up to you.
- UI should allow the user various actions on the retrieved data such as search and filtering.
- Must be able to display the repository name, author and link back to the repository.
- Must be able to display a more detailed view containing the readme and any additional information you deem necessary.
